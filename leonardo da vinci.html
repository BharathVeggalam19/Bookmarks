<p>Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was an Italian polymath of the Renaissance, excelling as a painter, scientist, engineer, inventor, and anatomist. He is best known for masterpieces like *Mona Lisa* and *The Last Supper*. His notebooks contain groundbreaking studies in anatomy, flight, hydraulics, and mechanics. Though many of his inventions were never built, his visionary ideas influenced future technologies. Leonardo's curiosity and interdisciplinary approach made him one of history’s greatest geniuses.</p>
<p>Leonardo is world-famous for his paintings, especially the Mona Lisa, known for her mysterious smile, and The Last Supper, a masterful depiction of emotion and composition. However, his talents went far beyond art.</p>
